### Solution
Implemented in React. The app takes an input from the user and on valid input, generates 4 scrollable tables and a profile cards for each member. By default, the page requests 'boomtownroi' but any valid org can be used as an endpoint. The app is mobile-responsive down to a width of 300px. The external dependencies used are: 'SASS' for CSS conversion and 'Moment' for formatting dates. The builtin dependencies were for 'useEffect' and 'useState'
    # Input Handling
        Input is processed by the SearchBar component. SearchBar updates an input variable on keypress and on button click returns the input to its parent GitAPI via prop.
        At the GitAPI level, the prop is appended to the base URL 'api.github.com/orgs' and performs a fetch request. If the response contains an 'id' field in the JSON then the data is accepted. Otherwise, the response is considered 'invalid' and the corresponding 'none found' messages are relayed to the user.
    
    # Table Generation
        Repos, Events, Hooks, and Issues all create tables. Each of these components is passed the base URL as a prop from GitAPI and appends to it based on their fetch destination. Their content is populated simply by iterating through the JSON they fetch.
    
    # Card Generation
        User profile cards are generated by Member and Members. Members fetches in the same way as the other components and creates a Member component for each index of the array of JSON objects. Member is the child of Members and takes the user information as a prop to generate a styled card.

### Future Improvements
    Abstracting a function for useState and fetch would improve the portability of the program as many components call fetch from within useEffect. It's worth considering creating a base class for the components to inherit from as well; all components have an 'ID' field and many contain 'updated_at', 'created_at', and some kind of url and name.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
